Version 1.1.1 - Critical Fixes

What's Fixed:
• Fixed failed upload retry system - recordings now properly retry when upload fails
• Fixed backend transcription for recordings over 20 minutes - chunking now works correctly
• Added visibility for pending/failed uploads on home screen with status badges
• Pull-to-refresh now properly retries failed uploads
• Fixed authentication issues with upload queue
• Improved error handling and reliability

All recordings are saved locally first to prevent data loss, then uploaded automatically when connection is available.
